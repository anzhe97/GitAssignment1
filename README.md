This article talked about general trends happening in Software Engineering, like the increased use of GitHub
that allow people to share work and cloud computing for delivering software. I found the article to be 
interesting since it takes into account the increased number of software available which means software 
engineers are becoming more specialized in particular fields. I also found it interesting that it makes 
mention of agile methodology and how the focus is on getting software to customers or to representing customers
as quickly as possible. It also goes on to explain the agile methodology and lists it as a trend that sofware
engineering is moving toward.
